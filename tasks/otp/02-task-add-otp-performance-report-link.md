# Task — Add OTP Performance Report Link to README

## Goal
Add a reference link to the **Phase 1 OTP Performance Report (Persian)** in the main project README, under the section that discusses **load / performance testing**.

This task is documentation-only and must not change any code or tests.

---

## Context
A new performance report has been added to the project documentation:

- File: `docs/OTP_Performance_Report_Phase1_FA.md`

This report documents capacity and steady-rate load tests for the OTP service and must be discoverable from the main README.

---

## Files / Paths
- `README.md`
- `docs/OTP_Performance_Report_Phase1_FA.md` (already exists; do NOT modify)

---

## Steps
1. Open `README.md`.
2. Locate the section related to **Load Testing**, **Performance Testing**, or **k6 tests**.
3. Under that section, add a bullet or subsection linking to the OTP performance report.
4. Use a clear, descriptive link title (do not rename the report file).

### Suggested Markdown Entry
```md
- **OTP Service – Performance Report (Phase 1, FA):**
  [docs/OTP_Performance_Report_Phase1_FA.md](docs/OTP_Performance_Report_Phase1_FA.md)
```

---

## Constraints
- Do NOT change any existing content other than adding the link.
- Do NOT rename files.
- Do NOT reformat unrelated sections of the README.
- Keep the change minimal and localized.

---

## Done When
- `README.md` contains a working link to `docs/OTP_Performance_Report_Phase1_FA.md`
- The link is placed under the load/performance testing section.
- No other files are modified.
